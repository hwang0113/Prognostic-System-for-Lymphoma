# Prognostic-System-for-Lymphoma
This is the README file for the computer code in R for the manuscript entitled "Using machine learning to expand the Ann Arbor staging system for Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma " by Huan Wang, Zhenqiu Liu, Julie Yang, Li Sheng, and Dechang Chen.

* The file "functions.R" contains R functions for estimating weighted differences in hazards. 
* The file "main program.R" contains the code to create the EACCD prognostic system for Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. 
* The file "plot.R" contains the code to plot the dendrogram, C-index curve, and survival curves of the prognostic groups for the EACCD lymphoma prognostic system. 
* The file "validate.R" contains the code to validate the EACCD lymphoma prognostic system.
* The file "AnnArbor.R" contains the code to generate the C-index and survival curves of the Ann Arbor stages.
